(adapted and expanded from § 24A of <cite>Hindi Structures</cite>)</center><p>

      It is natural to wonder what the difference
in meaning is between the compound and non-compound [or "simple"] forms 
of a given verb in contexts where either form occurs. There is no formula that can be
mechanically used to decide when to use a compound verb and when no to.
Not enough is known about the meanings of the compound verb to provide
such instruction, even if there were space to write it all down. Correct
use of the compound verb is a matter that is much more complex and subtle
than learning the correct use of the causative or the subjunctive. It is
something one learns gradually over the years, after hearing and seeing
the compound verb thousands of times and after making many mistakes which, 
with a bit of luck, native speakers of Hindi will correct. However, this
is not to make an unfathomable mystery out of it. There is a great deal
one can learn by conscious attention, study, and practice. <br clear="none" />

      First we will look at some general
formulations of the difference in meaning between the compound and the
simple verb. Then we will examine how these differences are realized in
concrete situations. <br clear="none" />

      An action may be thought of as consisting of
a number of stages or phases. First is the stage of inaction, of intention
and preparation; then comes the stage of effort; then the consummation of
action leading to achievement, change or transition to something new. In
most general terms, using a compound verb allows the mind to travel across
the phases of an action. Using the simple verb illuminates a single stage.
(However, the choice of when to let the mind travel fully through the
phases of an action and when not to is not a matter of simple whim. There
is remarkable agreement about when a full look is appropriate and when a
simple flash will do. This agreement is such that speakers of Hindi are
able to restore an author's choices to a doctored text with a high degree
of accuracy, provided they are able to see the full context.) <br clear="none" />

      If someone says दोस्त हमारे घर में आया
 in one's mind's eye one sees the friend inside the house. But if one says 
दोस्त हमारे घर में आ गया, this fairly simple picture becomes complicated or 
deepened in some way. One may think of the friend as someone successively 
outside and then inside the house. One becomes conscious of both the process 
and the result of his passage into the house. Or, depending on context 
or intonation, one may come to know the speaker's attitude toward this event, 
that is, how it changed him. Perhaps he'd been waiting for someone and 
is relieved by their return: </p><p>

     1. "मैं बहुत खुश हूँ क्योंकि तुम आख़िरकार हमारे घर में वापस आ गए हो ।"  
    [punjabscreen.blogspot.com] <br clear="none" />

           'I am very happy that finally you've come back home.' </p><p>

Or perhaps the speaker is annoyed by their return: </p><p>

      2. गब्बर: "फिर भी तुम लोग वापस आ गए ...  हरामजादो ..."  
    [www.hindivichar.com] <br clear="none" />

          Ghabbar Singh: "And still you came back?  Bastards!" </p><p>

     Using the non-compound or simple verb 
to express an action usually indicates that the speaker is interested only 
in registering the result of the action. That is why the simple verb occurs 
to express actions whose results are routine, predictable, not 
out of the normal: </p><p>

      3. आपका खत मिला जो आपने 11 अगस्त को भेजा था | 
    [www.samyaksanvad.com]<br clear="none" />

          'I got your letter which you'd sent on August 11th.' </p><p><a name="003" shape="rect">

To say मिल गया here might imply that the speaker was unhappy to get it, 
or had been anxiously waiting for it or that it had been lost and was found it again. 
The compound verb supports numerous possible interpretations. Another example:  </a></p><p>



      4. मेरा जनम उन्नीस सौ बयालीस में हुआ | <br clear="none" />

         'I was born in 1942.' </p><p>

To use the compound हो गया in  (4) would have humorous effect: 
Maybe I was born by mistake or without wanting to or after having waited around 
(in heaven?) for a long time. Or after several attempts. In short, using the compound 
instead of the non-compound in reporting my birthdate forces the hearer to entertain 
one or another implausible alternative to my simply being born when I was. <br clear="none" /><a name="004" shape="rect">

    For smilar reasons, reporting a usually unforeseeable event - 
such as an earthquake - is almost always expressed by a non-compound verb: </a></p><p>

      5.   ग्यारह मार्च को पूर्वोत्तर जापान में विनाशकारी भूकम्प आया था।    
[www.samaylive.com] <br clear="none" />

          'On March 11th there was a destructive earthquake 
in northeast Japan.' </p><p>

      Sometimes a non-compound is used not to
record a result without attention to the activity preceding it, but to
record preceding activity without attention to the result.  The
non-compound तसवीर बनाता हूँ in (6) refers to the effort to form a mental picture,
but in itself does not imply a successful completion of that effort: </p><p>

      6.  मैं तसवीर बनाता हूँ - तसवीर नहीं बनती ।             [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn5o6NMp-ZQ" shape="rect">song</a>
 from फ़िल्मः बारादरी (1955)] <br clear="none" />

          'I try to form a picture [but] the picture doesn't form.' </p><p><a name="005" shape="rect">

Substituting the corresponding compound form बना लेता हूँ for बनाता हूँ in the context of (6) creates a
contradiction. <br clear="none" /></a><a name="007" shape="rect">

      In contrast contexts which "set up" the conception of an action or event 
as complete strongly favor the use of a compound form of a verb: </a></p><p>

      7.  बारिश इतनी जोरदार थी कि शहर की तमाम सड़कें व गलियां पानी से भर गई |  
    [www.article.wn.com] <br clear="none" />

          'The rain was so heavy that all the city streets and lanes flooded with water.' 
</p><p>

Contrast (7) with (8) in which completeness is not "set up" by the preceding clause: </p><p>

      8.  बारिश इतनी जोरदार नहीं थी कि पानी सड़क पर भरता। 
    <a href="http://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/ghaziabad-12479844.html" shape="rect">context</a><br clear="none" />

          'The rain was not so heavy that water flooded onto the street.' 
</p><p><a name="009" shape="rect">

      While completeness is one of the primary 
meanings of the compound verb, it is not its only meaning. Two other meanings of
the compound verb [when opposed to the corresponding non-compound] are anteriority 
and ease.  Anteriority: If speakers wish to show that one action is complete <b>before</b> 
another they may indicate this by expressing the earlier action with a compound verb: </a></p><p>

      9. हमारे कामों की सूची शाखा में हमारे पहुँचने से पहले ही पहुँच जाती थी |  
    [pittpat.blogspot.com]  <br clear="none" />

          'Our task list would get to our branch before we did.' 
</p><p>

     10. ''ओह, आज तो मैं बहुत थक गई हूं, फिर भी समय होते-होते पहुंच ही गई।''
     [rsaudr.org] <br clear="none" />

           "Oh, today I am so tired. Even so I got here before time."  </p><p>

It is not so surprising then that if speakers want to emphasize that one action occurs <b>after</b> 
another they tend to use the non-compound verb:  </p><p><a name="008" shape="rect">

     11. या तो दमकल पहुंचती ही नहीं है, या फिर सब कुछ जलकर राख हो जाने के बाद ही पहुंचती है।  
    [m.jagran.com]<br clear="none" />

          'Either the fire department doesn't come at all or it gets there after 
everything has burnt to ash.'  </a></p><p>

Ease: If an action or result is easily achieved then the compound verb is 
more likely to be used than if difficulties or obstacles have to be overcome: </p><p><a name="012" shape="rect">

     12. लोगों से सुना था कि मुंबई में नौकरी आसानी से मिल जाती है। 
    [www.goswamirishta.com] <br clear="none" />

           'I'd heard from folks that in Mumbai 
it is easy to get a job.'  </a></p><p>

     13. आज के ज़माने में नौकरी मुश्किल से मिलती है |      
[www.hastakshep.com] <br clear="none" />

           'These days it is hard to get a job.'  </p><p><a name="010" shape="rect">

      A subtler function of the compound verb depends 
on a speaker or writer creating expectations in the hearer or reader's mind
 - which are then contradicted or belied. In (14) the use of the compound verb 
in the second sentence depends on the first sentence's setting up the expectation 
that it is at night that the leopard comes to drink.  The second sentence expresses 
an exception to that.  (Notice that between the two actions there is no difference 
in completeness or anteriority or ease.) </a></p><p><a name="08606" shape="rect">

     14. रात को यहाँ  रोज़ पानी पीने आता है. कभी-कभी दोपहर में भी आ जाता है ।  <br clear="none" />

          'Every day he comes here at night to get a 
drink.  Occasionally he comes here in the afternoon, too.' 
</a></p><p>

             (from Chapter Seven of गोदान.  See <a href="godan07.html#08602" shape="rect">context</a>.) </p><p>

 Another example of the same kind: </p><p><a name="01125" shape="rect">

    15. भोला ग्वाला था और दूध-मक्खन का व्यवसाय करता था. 
अच्छा दाम मिल जाने पर कभी-कभी किसानों के हाथ गायें बेच भी देता था. <br clear="none" />

         'Bhola was a dairyman and had a milk and 
butter business.  Sometimes, if the price was right, <br clear="none" />
          he'd also sell cows to the farmers.'</a></p><p>

          (from Chapter One of गोदान.  See <a href="godan01.html#01121" shape="rect">context</a>.) </p><p>

The second sentence in (15) expresses a departure from Bhola's
normal business and as such gets the compound बेच दे-. <br clear="none" /><a name="012" shape="rect">

      Because the compound verb draws 
the hearer's attention from one stage of an action to another, 
its use runs the risk of impoliteness.  In English it is not proper 
to be overly specific, to say things like "Eat this!" or "Take this and drink it!" when 
offering snacks or drinks to guests.   Similarly, using compound 
verb forms such as आ जाइए instead of आइए or बैठ जाइए instead of  बैठिए may 
strike the hearer as peremptory and unwelcoming.  It is rude to say बैठ जाइए 
['Sit down!'] instead of  बैठिए ['Have a seat.'] - unless you really mean it! </a></p><p><a name="016" shape="rect">

   16. वेंकय्या नायडू जी ने बोला पप्पू जी बैठ जाइए प्लीज ! <br clear="none" />

         'Venkayya Naidu said, "Pappu ji, sit down please!"' </a></p><p>
