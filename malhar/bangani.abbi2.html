WORDS</font></p><p><font size="-1">Anvita Abbi</font></p><p><font size="-1">Jawaharlal Nehru University New Delhi,
India</font></p><p><font size="-1">ABSTRACT</font></p><p><font size="-1">An old debate on Bangani being related to Kentum
group of languages or not (Zoller 1988, 1989, 1993, Beekes 1995 and
van Driem and Sharma 1996) is worth investigating into the lexicon,
specially those words that belong to the 'basic word list' known to
be typically most resistant to change. The author conducted a couple
of field trips personally to investigate the phenomenon. The paper
discusses the results of this investigation.</font></p><p><font size="-1">As RUKI rule is claimed to be inoperative in many
Bangani words, the author has investigated, among others, words that
should have gone through the Rule but do not. The author,
surprisingly, confirms the existence of most, if not all, the words
listed in Zoller (1988) with specified meanings. Some semantic
variations was noticed though not totally disturbing the original
thesis. It is observed that near total multilingualism due to
language contact with Himachali and Hindi, (the languages of the
vicinity) at times, motivatesinformants to oscillate between one form
and other. The paper is descriptive and not historical in nature and
thus avoids to attempt to establish the archaism of the disputed
words. At best, it expresses the multilayered lexicon of the language
indicative of long and stable multilingual communities in close
contact.</font></p><p><font size="-1">The region of Bangan is situated on the
western-most tip of Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh, bordering Himachal
Pradesh on one side, the tribal area of Jaunsar-Bawar and Tehfi
Garhwal on the other, and Dehradun district to the south. To the
north stand the lower Himalayas from the northern-most village of
Bangan, Monda, it is only a few kilometres to Changshil
glacier.</font></p><p><font size="-1">Bangani as a speech community exists socially and
linguistically demarcating itself from the neighbouring speech
communities more on the linguistic plain than on the social Heavy
multilingualism (near total bilingualism) and its penetrating
converging forces have not yet touched some of the archaic features
of the language -~,.'hich are very distinct from any other Indo-Aryan
languages of the neighbourhood Bangani's four tiered/layered
lexicon-system, existing through more than 3000 years suggests
retention of perhaps Pre Vedic Sanskrit words, some going as far back
as P1E and its branches of languages which are extinct now (such as
Kentum languages like Tocharian and Anatolian), coexisting with
Classical Sanskrit and Middle lndo-Aryan (mainly </font><i><font size="-1">tadbray) </font></i><font size="-1">words along with New
lndo-Aryan vocabulary highly substratumized by Hindi and its
dialects. The four layered system pose enough challenge for any
linguist to excavate the archaic words existing in the synchronic
Bangani which may relate to cognates of some Western lndo -European
languages as well as suggest to Latin origin of which there are no
traces of in any of the Indian languages. In fact lexicon of Bangani
exhibit North IA, South IA, as well as Western IE influence on
it.</font></p><p><font size="-1">- The controversy over the IE archaism and a
possible link to Kentum languages as suggested by Zoller (1988, 1989)
drew my attention to the possibility of the Bangani community as very
ancient, or heavily influenced by a very ancient speech community
which must have existed 5000 years ago. Zoller's claim about the
Kentum language affiliation and later the strong denial of such a
proposition by Beekes (1995) and van Driem et al (1996) was provoking
enough to visit the place in person. Zoller claims that words such as
</font><i><font size="-1">kosta </font></i><font size="-1">"a story"
or </font><i><font size="-1">kotia </font></i><font size="-1">"several hundred, hundreds of" are<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">from Kentum branch of languages thus retaining k-
and not going through the Ruki rule of palatalization. In fact, there
are eleven words in total with initial k- and seven<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-2">2</font></p><p><font size="-1">words with medial </font><i><font size="-1">-k-
</font></i><font size="-1">that he accounts for, some of them being
traced back to Kentum languages. We must recall that there is no
other language in India which can be considered a branch of Kentum
language family.</font></p><p><font size="-1">The question is, do these words exist in the
synchronic Bangani? If they do, what are their meanings? Has there
been a semantic shift (an expected shift/change in the course of
development)? If yes, where did Bangans come from? What are their
affiliations and how have they retained these structures till today?
I will restrict my investigation to first two linguistic questions
and will consider the last three questions/issues at some later date.
I would like to discuss only a select list of words with initial and
medial velars so as to throw some light on the (non)application of
the Ruki Rule</font></p><p><font size="-1">I will first give the word entry as given by
Zoller (1988. 1989) and then just below that our recent findings. The

</font></i><font size="-1">is also used for the meaning of
'happening', or to 'express what is concealed' such as in cases of
astrologer's predictions or doctor's diagnosis.</font></p><p><font size="-1">23(18) </font><b><i><font size="-1">goiNO
</font></i></b><font size="-1">'to sacrifice' <PIE g'heu- 'to

various other words for similar meaning such as </font><i><font size="-1">gaTo deno </font></i><font size="-1">or </font><i><font size="-1">phEra deno </font></i><font size="-1">our monolingual
informant aged 80 from Chinwa village rendered the following
sentence:</font></p><p><font size="-1">23.1 tini.apRO gOr-bar goINO</font></p><p><font size="-1">he refl. house-hold sacrificed</font></p><p><font size="-1">'he sacrificed his house-hold (worldly
pleasures)'<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">Not only from an old man like the case above we
also found members from Jagta village and a male informant aged 35
from the village Tiuni to attest this form as he gave us the
following sentence:<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">23.2 burhi-ai apNO gOr gOINOdi</font></p><p><font size="-1">old man refl. house sacrificed </font></p><p><font size="-1">'The old man sacrificed his house'</font></p><p><font size="-1">Another semantically related word that Zoller
presents in his work is </font><i><font size="-1">gomNO
</font></i><font size="-1">'to sacrifice' with the same etymon PIE
</font><i><font size="-1">gheu- </font></i><font size="-1">and
compares it with the OIA </font><i><font size="-1">hotna
</font></i><font size="-1">'libation, offering'. We had no problem in
acquiring this particular word also. Consider the following sentence,
which was given to us by a monolingual, 56, male member:<br clear="none" /></font></p><ol><li><font size="-1">dewe-rE cOkkOr-di mui badO gOm ai-gO </font></li></ol><p><font size="-1">god-gen swirl-loc i-dat all sacrifice GO
pst</font></p><p><font size="-1">I had to sacrifice everything because I was under
the influence of God'</font></p><p><font size="-1">Most of the informants (both male and female) were
of the view that the word meant 'to give up something without any
regrets and repent'. However, the entry no. 22 in Zoller's paper
</font><i><font size="-1">gOmi </font></i><font size="-1">'a
sacrificer' was attested for a very different meaning.<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">Almost all of the informants thought that the word
meant 'sad person'. Sentences like the following were very commonly
heard, even from monolinguals:</font></p><p><font size="-1">25.1 eu manuj hod gomi</font></p><p><font size="-1">this man very unhappy/sad</font></p><p><font size="-1">'he is a very unhappy man'</font></p><p><font size="-1">I wonder whether this particular word is a

through expected palatalization as witnessed in other IA
languages.</font></p><p><font size="-1">26 (23) </font><b><i><font size="-1">gOmbO,

</font><i><font size="-1">OIA jambha- </font></i><font size="-1">'tooth'.</font></p><p><font size="-1">We are not very sure of its wide prevalence as our
monolingual informant gave us the word </font><i><font size="-1">.l,'rnial'ho ~ dalhi </font></i><font size="-1">for molar
while some speakers from younger generation and bilinguals
corroborated the word as in the sentence as:<br clear="none" /></font></p><ol><li><font size="-1">merO gumbO dukhto lOgOndi </font></li></ol><p><font size="-1">my jaw pain feel</font></p><p><font size="-1">'My jaw is aching'</font></p><ol><li><font size="-1">merE gumbE-di Da: lagi </font></li></ol><p><font size="-1">my molar-loc. pain feels </font></p><p><font size="-1">'I have pain in my molars'</font></p><p><font size="-1">Another archaic word which we could attest without
much problem was </font><i><font size="-1">gOsti </font></i><font size="-1">foreigner' <PIE </font><i><font size="-1">ghosti-

</font><i><font size="-1">gOsti </font></i><font size="-1">and
</font><i><font size="-1">gAsti </font></i><font size="-1">for the
same meaning. A minimal pair was found between </font><i><font size="-1">gOsti </font></i><font size="-1">and </font><i><font size="-1">gusti </font></i><font size="-1">(O vs.u). Thus
</font><i><font size="-1">gusti </font></i><font size="-1">meant
'internal desire' as rightly reported by Zoller as well as
'enjoyment' comparable to O1A </font><i><font size="-1">jusTi -
</font></i><font size="-1">'love, favour', Latin </font><i><font size="-1">gusto- </font></i><font size="-1">'taste' However, a female
informant aged 42 gave us </font><i><font size="-1">gusti
</font></i><font size="-1">for 'good taste' and </font><i><font size="-1">gOsti </font></i><font size="-1">for 'having fun', while
another female speaker from another village aged 65 thought that
</font><i><font size="-1">gOsti </font></i><font size="-1">meant
'guest'.</font></p><p><font size="-1">28 (25) </font><b><i><font size="-1">gO~ti</font></i></b><i><font size="-1"></font></i><font size="-1">'an expert' < PIE </font><i><font size="-1">g`nteh3-
</font></i><font size="-1">'to know, recognize'. Also compare
OIA</font><i><font size="-1"> jnya.'- </font></i><font size="-1">'to
recognize, know'. It was not very common word but nonetheless
attested by old and young, especially by those whose fluency in
second language was either marginal or for all practical purpose they
were monolinguals. Consider:<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">28.1 seu manuch-ai cori kOrne-di bOro gO~'ti

no. 26 in the Zoller list, i.e. </font><i><font size="-1">gO~:te:r
</font></i><font size="-1">'creator' <PIE g'enhl- 'to create'. He
relates this etymon to the one considered earlier, viz.
</font><i><font size="-1">gonNo </font></i><font size="-1">and
compares it with OIA </font><i><font size="-2">janitr
</font></i><font size="-1">'progenitor'. However, among many others
our monolingual and old informants one each from Jagta and Chinwa
village (aged 80 and 56 years respectively) could attest this word
without any problem. No one could explain the meaning very clearly
though the sentence rendered by them emoted a generic meaning of' the
ones which are created, i.e. creations'. The word under consideration
was always used in the context of God and its creations.
Consider:</font></p><p><font size="-1">29.1 tere caNo-di gO~te:r aye</font></p><p><font size="-1">yours created -gen creations came</font></p><p><font size="-1">'We, who are creation of yours have come'<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">29.2 ame bOgwan bade teri gO~te:r</font></p><p><font size="-1">we God all yours creations</font></p><p><font size="-1">' Oh God!

</font></i><font size="-1">'snow' , OIA </font><i><font size="-1">hima- </font></i><font size="-1">'snow'.<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">Almost all our informants confirmed using this
word for the month of 'Paus'(winter) In general it meant 'cold and
damp'. Our monolingual informant aged 80 uttered the following while
discussing cold climate.</font></p><ol><li><font size="-1">posE-rE mi:nE~'-di lage gim-gimO~ </font></li></ol><p><font size="-1">Poos-gen month-loc feels cold (partial

the following.<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">30.2 eu moino boRo gimO~<br clear="none" />

this month very cold<br clear="none" />

'This is a very cold month'</font></p><p><font size="-1">Another related etymon mentioned by Zoller and
very prevalently used in the region is:</font></p><p><font size="-1">31 (28) </font><b><i><font size="-1">gimia:LO</font></i></b><i><font size="-1"></font></i><font size="-1">'the coldness which prevails before snowfall'. A slight
variation in meaning was noticed. That is, </font><i><font size="-1">gimia:LO </font></i><font size="-1">was used either for
'cold' as in 29 or for the concept of 'related to cold' such as in
phrases </font><i><font size="-1">Magh, Phagun. ('hOiter gimiaLO
</font></i><font size="-1">'The months of Magh, Phagun, Chair are
cold, ie. wintery'. Once asked in isolation/br the exact meaning of
the word. the prompt response came as "iu~ </font><i><font size="-1">walo" </font></i><font size="-1">i.e. days/months
ëpertaining to snow'.</font></p><p><font size="-1">(31) </font><b><i><font size="-1">getu</font></i></b><i><font size="-1"></font></i><font size="-1">'the resin from an oak-like tree'. <PIE </font><i><font size="-1">gu'etu- </font></i><font size="-1">'resin'. Compare OIA
</font><i><font size="-1">.jatu- </font></i><font size="-1">'lac,
gum'. We found many variants of this word along with the word
</font><i><font size="-1">getu </font></i><font size="-1">itself .
Most of the informants referred to resins of different trees while
</font><u><font size="-1">getu </font></u><font size="-1">specifically was referred to the resin of Ban and Chulu
trees.<br clear="none" /></font></p><p><font size="-1">31.1 meri culue-di ase makt~;-i getu </font></p><p><font size="-1">my Chulu-gen tree many resins</font></p><p><font size="-1">There are many resins in my Chulu tree'.</font></p><ol><li><font size="-1">bane-rE peRe. koi nikLE getu </font></li></ol><p><font size="-1">Ban-gen tree extract getu</font></p><p><font size="-1">'The extract of the Ban tree is known as
Getu'</font></p><p><font size="-2">19</font></p><p><font size="-1">The sentence 32.2 was rendered as an explanation
that was sought by us for the word under consideration. Notice the
typical syntactic structure of Hindi, a strong case of bilinguals are
in Hindi as well as strong urge to be 'helpful' to outsiders. We
tried to avoid collect such structures.</font></p><p><font size="-1">What does this all prove7 Zoller's contention is
correct. The language seems to have retained some very archaic
structures, retaining PIE </font><i><font size="-1">k-, -l~-, g- and
-g-. </font></i><font size="-1">Many. words in Bangani unlike other
IA languages of the region have not witnessed palatalization defying
RUKi Rule. It is difficult to prove at this point whether this is
because of its affiliation to Kenturn language as claimed by Zoller.
However, on the basis of the first-hand data acquired during these
two field trips. it can be said without any prejudices and with some
certainly that some Western Indo-European language (perhaps
Tokharian) of which we have no knowledge so far. either had a
significant role in substratumizing Bangani or, Bangani itself was
genetically related to this unknown Western IE language. There are
many other features in the language such as existence of
</font><b><font size="-1">O </font></b><font size="-1">as against
</font><b><font size="-1">a</font></b><font size="-1"> of I.Ir.,
pre-verbal auxiliaries (without being a V2 language system), and post
auxiliary negatives that may also be seen as retentions of archaic
structure in Bangani of which traces are only in Indo-European
languages (Abbi 1997 forthcoming).</font></p><p><font size="-1">Heavy multi-lingualism along with the sense of
language retention has given rise to a complex situation where
archaic structures coexist with those which share language change
processes (in phonology, morphology, and syntax) with the rest of the
IA languages spoken in South Asia. Needless to emphasize further,
future linguistic research at all levels is warranted in Bangan
region especially by those linguists who are engaged in
socio-historical linguistics.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /></font></p><p><b><font size="-1">A Note on Methodology</font></b></p><p>A field-trip was undertaken by the author along with two of her
students Ms Sunita Singh and Mr Pradeep Kumar in the month of
September 1995. A number of tape-recordings of interviews and songs
were also made Several informants of both genders also taped the word
list given in the paper Later in December 1995 I along with seven
students (two females and five males) went to the interiors of Bangan
and in all visited several villages such as, Jagta, Chinwa, Dzola
Dogri, Moldi Dogri, Tikochi, Barnall, Airala Dogri, Bhattadi Dogri.
Kiranu, Duchanu (all in Kothigarh belt), as well as Arakot. Pitlasu,
Ravana. Canto. Saran, and Bhutanu (all in Pingalpatti). We had to
scale, at times the height of 3000 Mrs in cold snowy winter Most of
the words were attested in Chinwa (houses 28-30 households) and Jagta
(has 14 Chauhan families and 18 Koli families). All villages are
approachable on fi~ot, as there is only one motorable road, which
does not touch many villages As our objective during the second trip
was wider, I and my students interacted w'ith and observed close to
100 members of the speech community, including village gatherings and
discourse contexts of various types, such as a group of D<i>evals
</i>with their women before a religious rituals in a tent outside a
temple in the afternoon, a village gathering for a quasi-religious,
ritualistic 'performance' at night; informal but animated discussions
among village elders over tea at a Sarpanch's house on a kev day in
the village calendar; relaxed dinner-time family conversations in the
kitchen conversation with mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the
kitchen while they were cooking lunch ( being a woman, I enjoyed a
special privilege to be invited right in the kitchen where women
folks exchanged recipes with me); conversation with our 80 year old
informant while he kept working with his hammer (he was a
blacksmith)--all revealing linguistically significant behaviour <font size="-1">patterns and invaluable pieces of information on the speech
community's state of health (as we were obviously very concerned
about the obsolescencing phenomenon. if at all, existed because of
heavy bilingualism) and vigour. The multilingual component of Bangani
speech community, at times, gives a trying time to any field linguist
to separate the old from the new. However, in remote villages like
Jagta and Chinwa we could identify old men and women whose competence
in Hindi or in any other language was minimal. Coupled with indirect
observational technique, one employed direct questioning methods to
extract relevant information Tape recordings were made wherever its
imperativeness was felt. It is to be noted that people love to be
taped and heard their own voice, and hence recording speeches in
Indian villages is not any problem. The presence of a tape recorder
motivated many of them to render songs and ballads. I thank to all
our informants for their co-operation and hospitality.</font></p><p><font size="-2">21</font></p><p><b><font size="-1">References:</font></b></p><p><font size="-1">Abbi, Anvita 1997. Redundancies and Restructuring
