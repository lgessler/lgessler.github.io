        I was standing in the park with (my) hands
stuck ( <font face="Xdvng">Ral:</font> ) in (my) pockets. I ( <font face="Xdvng">m:ØJ:ð</font> ) had already been two (or) three
hours wandering (through) the whole bazaar in search ( <font face="Xdvng">t:l:aS: m:ðø</font> ) of a book written by a
professor of mine. How old and tired my professor looked ( <font face="Xdvng">l:g:</font> ) and still his books didn't sell.<br />

        I saw her (as she was) getting down from a
moving bus. She was wearing a beautiful ( <font face="Xdvng">Q:Üb:s:Ürt:</font> ) red dress. I watched ( <font face="Xdvng">dðK:t:a rh</font> ) her cross the street with ( <font face="Xdvng">el:y:ð hØO</font> ) a silk ( <font face="Xdvng">rðS:m:</font> ) umbrella and sweater knit from ( <font face="Xdvng">ka</font> ) wool in (her) hand. Going toward the river, she
stopped by a bridge made of stone.<br />

        Suddenly someone screamed ( <font face="Xdvng">ec:ll:a</font> ) and she began to run toward a man drowning
in the water. Catching his hand, she pulled ( <font face="Xdvng">K:iøc: l:a</font> ) him out of the water. Then she saw
that he was holding on to a large floating piece ( <font face="Xdvng">XØk_a</font> ) of wood. And then I saw that the man's
smiling face was my old, tired professor's!<br />

        When I left, the two of them, sitting among
the flowers, were talking and basking in the sun ( <font face="Xdvng">D:Üp: s:ðk</font> ).<br />
