Advanced Levels of Hindi-Urdu Acquisition and Research </center><p>

This page is an index of links to other
pages which in turn are drafts of parts of a network of web-based
<b>classroom-compatible</b> materials for learning, teaching, and
exploring advanced (post second-year) levels of Hindi.  </p><p>

      (7) <a href="sindex.html" shape="rect">Index</a> to Sanskrit 
pages. (Not part of Mellon Project.) </p><p><a name="fn1" shape="rect">

The creation of these materials during the late Nineties and the early Aughts 
was supported by funds from the Mellon Foundation as
well as by a Visitorship (in 1999-2000) at the Institute for the Study of
Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa at the Tokyo University of
Foreign Studies. Preparation for the project was materially assisted by a
Fulbright-Hays Research Abroad Award. In conception and design it owes 
inspiration to Vasu Renganathan's online Tamil project created during 
his years at the University of Michigan.  This (2015) edition of Malhar owes 
its re-emergence  after ten years of inaccessibility to the expert intervention 
of Lawrence Hook. </p><p>

It is my hope that interested parties will have a look at these pages and 
let me have their ideas on how I might improve their effectiveness, 
platform-stability, and user-friendliness. I would also appreciate suggestions 
about what to include (and what to omit). </p><p>
