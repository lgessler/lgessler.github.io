= Honey Rye Bière de Garde
:date: 2022-06-14

== Introduction
This is a modified version of link:https://homebrewacademy.com/biere-de-garde-recipe/[Martin Keen's Bière de Garde] with rye providing additional aromatic complexity.
Another difference is that I went for a two-step mash at 145F and 152F to try to get some additional efficiency.
My batch started at 1.070 and ended at 1.003 for a whopping 8.79% ABV, though the final product is in my opinion very smooth for how strong it is.

I let the beer sit in the bottle for 6 months before consuming: when young, the beer was still a little harsh and had an exceptionally creamy mouthfeel, perhaps too creamy.
After a few months, the culture has done a good job of cleaning up some off flavors, and you're left with a very dry and aromatic beer with a fine lacy carb and an appropriate amount of creamy mouthfeel.
