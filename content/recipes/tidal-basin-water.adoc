= Tidal Basin Water
:date: 2023-03-12

== Introduction
This is a gin-based drink that aims to capture the flavors and feeling of spring.
It is named for the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_Basin[Tidal Basin] in Washington, D.C., the home of many of D.C.'s fabulous cherry blossom trees.

This recipe distinctively features a gin infused with rose petals, lemon oleo saccharum simple syrup, and the use of a variety of floral and fruity ingredients, all of which combine to give the drink a complex but still delicate and light aromatic character.
A more floral gin like Hendrick's might be best, but I used this recipe with great success using Beefeater, a London Dry.

== Ingredients
* 1750mL gin
* 100 rose petals
* 440mL triple sec
* 440mL tart cherry juice
* 440mL lemon juice
* 350mL lemon oleo saccharum simple syrup
* 220g tart cherry preserves
* 30mL peach schnapps
* _optional_ Several drops of rosewater
* _optional_ Several drops of orange blossom water
* 4L club soda

== Recipe
1. Infuse gin with rose petals, letting sit at room temperature for 12 hours before straining.
2. In a mixing bowl, decant some (~500mL) of the gin and muddle the tart cherry preserves so that no clumps remain.
3. Transfer mixed gin and preserves to serving vessel, and combine all ingredients except club soda. Mix well.
4. Add several cubes of ice and club soda.
5. Serve over ice.
