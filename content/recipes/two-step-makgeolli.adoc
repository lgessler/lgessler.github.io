= Two-step Makgeolli
:date: 2023-03-14

== Introduction
Makgeolli (막걸리) is the indigenous wine-like fermented beverage of Korea.
This is my favorite recipe for making it, given by link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYthaNAONfI[Jeff Rubidge] and typed out by someone in the comments.
For more information on Makgeolli, I recommend link:https://takjoo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-primer-on-brewing-makgeolli.pdf[Becca Baldwin and Daniel Lenaghan's primer].
