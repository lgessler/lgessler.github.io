= Purple Paloma in Thailand (NA)
:date: 2023-03-12

== Introduction
This non-alcoholic paloma gets its complexity from a ginger and lime leaf infused syrup with agave nectar.
It is made purple with the addition of butterfly pea flower tea, and the color can be adjusted as desired with the use of some brewing salts if you have them on hand.
(The exact color expressed by anthocyanins in butterfly pea flower tea are responsive to pH.)

== Ingredients
* 1L grapefruit juice
* 500mL lime juice
* 2 cups ginger, peeled and sliced
* 2 cups white sugar
* 1.5 cups water
* 1/2 cup agave nectar
* 15 kaffir lime leaves
* 30 butterfly pea flowers
* 2L Club Soda
* _optional_ food-grade calcium carbonate and baking soda

== Recipe
1. Combine ginger, lime leaves, sugar, water, and agave nectar in a pot. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and lightly boil for 15 minutes, then take off heat and let steep for 1 to 2 hours. Strain and set aside.
2. Steep butterfly pea flowers in enough boiling water to fully submerge them. Cover and let steep for 5 minutes.
3. Combine syrup and all ingredients except salts and club soda in serving vessel with ice and stir well.
4. Add club soda.
5. Adjust pH as desired with baking soda and calcium carbonate.
