= Autumn Spiced Syrup
:date: 2023-12-02

== Introduction
What is the ultimate autumn cocktail?
This is the question that came to me with the first cold morning of October, and this is an important part of my answer.
We're going to make a syrup with some fairly expected spices, and importantly, the sugar is going to be brown in order to incorporate the taste of caramelized sugar.
The recipe below calls for brown sugar, but I actually used some link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_sugar[palm sugar] lying around my cupboard that I needed to use up, which inched my syrup a little more towards more floral notes.
It'd probably be a waste to use maple syrup in the syrup directly, but consider mixing a bit into a cocktail as you're using the syrup.

So what was my ultimate autumn cocktail?
I tried a few different things with this syrup, and my favorite one was the following, served over a large piece of ice:

* 10mL autumn spiced syrup
* 30mL applejack (I used Laird's)
* 15mL Batavia Arrack van Oosten
* 1 orange peel, expressed (or a couple drops of orange bitters)

== Ingredients
* 1/4 of a whole nutmeg seed, chopped into a few pieces
* 1 2" stick of cinnamon (I used Chinese cinnamon, _cinnamomum cassia_)
* 5 cloves
* 8 allspice berries, cracked
* 5 whole black peppercorns, cracked
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 cup water

== Recipe
1. Bring water to a boil in a pot
2. Add sugar and stir to dissolve
3. Reduce heat to a low simmer
4. Add all spices and continue simmering for two minutes
5. Remove from heat and let stand for around 60 minutes
6. Strain into a container and refrigerate once cooled
